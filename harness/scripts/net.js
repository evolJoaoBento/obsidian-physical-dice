 * Fitting a net by arithmetic does not survive contact with the art. The d6 is
 * a grid and the d8 is a clean zigzag, but the d20 sheet is neither: scanlines
 * through it show vertical rules that no strip of equilateral triangles
 * explains, and a row height that divides 1024 into five while the strip's own
 * width says otherwise.
 *
 * So read it instead. Cell interiors are a flat wash, the digits sit inside
 * them, and every cell is fenced off by a drawn border, which makes each cell
 * exactly one connected region. Flood them, hull them, and reduce each hull to
 * the corner count the shape actually has - triangles for a d4/d8/d20,
 * pentagons for a d12.
