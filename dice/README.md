# Dice packs

A pack is a folder in here. It holds the art for a set of dice and a
`pack.json` describing them. Copy `Texture-Pack-Default`, edit it, and pick the
new folder under **Dice pack** in the plugin's settings.

Everything about a set lives in its folder. The plugin's settings decide how big
the dice are overall and where the tray sits; the pack decides everything else,
colour included - a set is red or bone or black the way it is a particular
shape.

## The folder

```
My-Pack/
  pack.json
  d6_Numbers.png
  d20_Numbers.png
  ...
```

File names are up to you - `pack.json` says which file belongs to which die.
Without a `pack.json` the plugin looks for `<type>_Numbers.png` and leaves the
dice otherwise plain.

## The art

A face sheet is a **mask, not a picture**. Where it is transparent the die shows
its own colour, so the sheet paints only what is printed on the die: a faint
wash inside each face and opaque white digits. A fully opaque sheet will hide
the die's colour entirely, and `color` below will then appear to do nothing.

The sheets that ship here are 1024x1024 with the net drawn once, unfolded.

## pack.json

### geometry

Which solid to build, when it is not the one the die is named after. This is
what makes a percentile die possible: it is a retextured d10, so it says
`"geometry": "d10"` and everything shape-derived - the collision hull, the face
count, the blob shadow - follows the d10 rather than looking for a hundred-sided
solid that does not exist.

A die named after a solid the plugin knows needs no `geometry`.

### numbers

Which number each face carries, in **three.js's face order** - not the art's.
It is here to be kept in step with the cells, not to be chosen freely: the
values ship paired so opposite faces sum the way a die's should (7 on a d6, 9 on
a d8 and d10, 13 on a d12, 21 on a d20). Reorder them and the die still works,
but its opposite faces stop adding up.

A d10 counts from zero and really does have a face reading zero. A percentile
die counts 00 to 90 and its opposite faces sum to 90.

### turn, mirror, vertices

`turn` picks which of a cell's corners the die's first vertex lands on;
`mirror` reverses the winding. The artist drew each digit for one particular
unfolding and nothing in the geometry knows which, so these are read off a
rendered die rather than reasoned about.

`vertices` is for corner-read art. A d4 has no upward face, so it is read at the
corner its resting face leaves out, and every cell carries three digits - one by
each corner - instead of one in the middle. Setting `vertices` names the die
corner each cell corner belongs to, and `turn` and `mirror` are then ignored.

### bevel.smooth

A chamfer built the obvious way is a ring of flat facets, and flat facets read
as exactly that - the edge stops being sharp and starts being a bevel, which is
a different hard edge. `smooth` fixes that without a single extra vertex: it
averages the normals meeting along the rim so the light travels continuously
across it and off onto the face, which is what a rounded edge looks like. The
silhouette stays faceted, but at a tenth of a die nobody is reading the
silhouette.

0 leaves the chamfer flat, 1 rounds it fully. It does nothing when `enabled` is
false - with no rim there is nothing to round, and bending a numbered face's
normals would only shade its digit unevenly.

### rimUV

A point on the sheet with nothing printed on it. Bevelled edges wear it. Pick
somewhere clear of the net - the last column, or a corner the net does not
reach.

Blank sheet has no wash on it, so left alone a rim would come out the die's
colour undarkened while every face came out a sixth darker, and the bevel would
read as a bright stripe round a duller die. The plugin measures the wash off the
sheet - the commonest colour-and-alpha it paints, digits aside - and lays it
over this corner of the texture exactly as a cell lays it over a face, so the
two match without a pack having to arrange it.

## Working them out

Two harness scripts do the tedious part, and both want Obsidian running with the
plugin's debug port open (see `harness/README.md`):

- `harness/scripts/net.js` reads a sheet and hands back every cell's corners.
  Cells are fenced off by the drawn border, so it floods each one, hulls it, and
  reduces the hull to the corner count the shape has. Set `window.__type` and
  `window.__sides` first.
- `harness/scripts/overlay.js` draws a table back over the sheet it describes.
  Outlines that land on the drawn borders say the corners are right; labels that
  land on the matching digits say the numbers are. Check a table this way rather
  than by reading digits off a rendered die - a digit drawn rotated in the net
  reads as a different digit, and a 2 turned upside down has been called a 5
  here more than once.
