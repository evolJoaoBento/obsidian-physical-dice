     * cube projects to a plain square and reads as a paper tile. The rim strips
     * face partly sideways, so they take the key light at their own angle and
     * draw a lit border around whatever number is up.
     *
     * Every face is pulled in towards its own centre, which leaves it flat, in
     * the same plane, and the same shape - so the atlas still lands on it
     * exactly as before. The gap that opens along each edge is bridged by a
     * strip, and the gap at each corner by a cap. Those come after the numbered
     * faces in the buffer, so anything walking faces by index has to be told
     * where they stop; that is what faceVertexCount is for.
     *
     * Shrinking towards the centre is a true chamfer only for a regular face.
     * The d10's kites are not regular and come out very slightly uneven, which
     * at the width of a rim is not a thing anyone can see.
     *
     * Physics keeps the full sharp hull. A tenth of a face is not worth a second
     * collision shape, and a die that looks a hair smaller than it collides is
     * the error nobody notices.
